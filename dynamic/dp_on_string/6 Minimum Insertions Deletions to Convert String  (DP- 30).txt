Minimum Insertions/Deletions to Convert String | (DP- 30)

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.

In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
word1 and word2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

Approach:

The algorithm is stated as follows:

Let n and m be the length of str1 and str2 respectively.
Find the length of the longest common subsequence ( say k) of str1 and str2 as discussed in  Longest Common Subsequence.
Return (n-k) + (m-k) as answer.

class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s,string t) {
        int n = s.size();
        int m = t.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1,vector<int>(m+1,0));
        for(int i = 1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            for(int j = 1;j<=m;j++)
            {
                if(s[i-1]==t[j-1]){
                    dp[i][j]=1+dp[i-1][j-1];
                }
                else dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    };
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        if(word1==word2) return 0;
        if(word1.size()==1 && word2.size()==1) return 2;
        int n = longestPalindromeSubseq(word1,word2);
        cout<<n;
        return word1.size()+word2.size()-(2*n);
    }
