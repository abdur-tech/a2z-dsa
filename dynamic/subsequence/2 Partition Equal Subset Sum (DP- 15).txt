Partition Equal Subset Sum (DP- 15)

We are given an array ‘ARR’ with N positive integers. We need to find if we can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of elements of each subset is equal to the other.
If we can partition, return true else return false.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.


This question is a slight modification of the problem discussed in Subset-sum equal to target. We need to partition the array(say S) into two subsets(say S1 and S2). According to the question:

Sum of elements of S1 + sum of elements of S2 = sum of elements of S.
Sum of elements of S1 = sum of elements of S2.
These two conditions imply that S1 = S2 = (S/2). 

Now, 

If S (sum of elements of the input array) is odd , there is no way we can divide it into two equal halves, so we can simply return false.
If S is even, then we need to find a subsequence in the input array whose sum is equal to S/2 because if we find one subsequence with sum S/2, the remaining elements sum will be automatically S/2. So, we can partition the given array. Hence we return true.
