Number of substring containing all three characters


1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1

    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {

        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<s.size();i++)
        {
            count[s[i]-'a']=i;
            if(count[0]!=-1 && count[1]!=-1 && count[2]!=-1){ //Even if do not check if condition no issue, one count will be -1 and ans will not change
                ans+=1 + min(count[0],min(count[1],count[2]));
            }
        }
        return ans;
