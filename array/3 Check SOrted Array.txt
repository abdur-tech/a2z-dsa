Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.

Example 2:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {5,4,6,7,8}
Output: False.
Explanation: The given array is Not sorted i.e Every element in the array is not smaller than or equal to its next values, So the answer is False.

Here element 5 is not smaller than or equal to its future elements.


int isSorted(int n, vector<int> a) {
    // Write your code here.
    for(int i = 1;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(a[i]<a[i-1]) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
