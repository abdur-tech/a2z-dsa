Problem Statement: Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Example 1: 

Input: arr[1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

Output: arr[1,2,3,_,_,_,_]

Explanation: Total number of unique elements are 3, i.e[1,2,3] and Therefore return 3 after assigning [1,2,3] in the beginning of the array.


int removeDuplicates(vector<int> &arr, int n) {
    int c = 0;
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i]!=arr[i+1]){
             c++;
        }
    }return c;
}
