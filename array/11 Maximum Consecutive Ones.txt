Problem Statement: find max 1 by flipping 0



Sample Input 1:
3 1
0 1 1
Sample Output 1:
3
Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
As there is at most one 1 that got flipped to 0, so for the worst-case scenario we can reflip the first index (1- based) to 1, resulting in a length of 3. 

int traffic(int n, int m, vector<int> vehicle) {
	// Write your code here.
	int i =0;
	int j = 0;
	int flip = m;
	int max_length = 0;
	for(int i = 0;i<n;i++)
	{
		
		if(vehicle[i]==0)
		{
			flip--;
			while(flip<0)
			{
				if (vehicle[j] == 0) {
				flip++;
				}
				j++;
        	}
		}
		max_length = max(max_length,i-j+1);
	}
	return max_length;
}
