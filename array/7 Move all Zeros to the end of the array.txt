Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Example 1:
Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

vector<int> moveZeros(int n, vector<int> arr) {
    // Write your code here.
    int k = 0;
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(arr[i]!=0)
        {
            swap(arr[i],arr[k]);
            k++;
        }
    }
    return arr;
}
