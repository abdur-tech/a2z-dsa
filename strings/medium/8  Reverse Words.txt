 Reverse Words

 Problem statement
You are given a string 'str' of length 'n'. You need to reverse the string word by word and return it.



Note:
Please note that there can be multiple spaces between two words, as well as leading or trailing spaces. 
However, in the reversed string output, there should only be a single space between two words, and the reversed string should not contain any leading or trailing spaces.


Example :
Input: 'str' = "Welcome to Coding Ninjas"

Output: Ninjas Coding to Welcome

Explanation:
If the given input string is "Welcome to Coding Ninjas", then you should return "Ninjas Coding to Welcome" as the reversed string

Sample Input 1 :
Welcome to Coding Ninjas


Sample Output 1:
Ninjas Coding to Welcome


Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The given input is "Welcome to Coding Ninjas". To obtain the desired output, we need to reverse the string and remove any leading or trailing spaces. 

The output is "Ninjas Coding to Welcome", where there is only a single space between two words and no leading or trailing spaces.


Sample Input 2 :
   I am a star


Sample Output 2:
star a am I

string revWords(string str) {
    int n = str.length();
    //removing leading space
    int i = 0;
    while(i<n && str[i]==' '){
        i++;
    }
    string ans="";
    string temp="";
    while(i<n)
    {
        char x = str[i];
        if(x!=' ')
        {
            temp+=x;
        }
        else if(x==' ')
        {
            if(ans==""){
                ans=temp;
            }
            else
            {
                if (temp != "") {
                  ans = temp + ' ' + ans;
                }
            }
            temp="";
           
        }
        i++;
    }
    if(temp!="") ans = temp+' '+ans;
    return ans;
}
