 Sorting Characters By Frequency

 Problem statement
You have been given a string ‘S’.



You must return the string ‘S’ sorted in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

If there are multiple answers, return any of them.



Example :
Let 'S'= “abAb”. 

Here the characters ‘a’ and ‘A’ have frequency 1 and character ‘b’ has frequency ‘2’.  

Therefore the sorted string is “bbAa”. 

string sortByFrequency(int n, string& s)
{
	// Take a Map to store char with count. 

map < char , int > mp;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        mp[s[i]]++; 
}
// make a string to store characters.
string str="";

for(auto it:mp)
{
	for(int i = 0;i<it.second;i++)
	{
		str+=it.first;
	}
}

    return str; 
}
