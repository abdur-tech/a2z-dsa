Search in a sorted 2D matrix
Problem Statement: You have been given a 2-D array ‘mat’ of size ‘N x M’ where ‘N’ and ‘M’ denote the number of rows and columns, respectively. The elements of each row are sorted in non-decreasing order. Moreover, the first element of a row is greater than the last element of the previous row (if it exists). You are given an integer ‘target’, and your task is to find if it exists in the given ‘mat’ or not.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 3, M = 4, target = 8,
mat[] = 
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 
9 10 11 12
Result: true
Explanation: The ‘target’  = 8 exists in the 'mat' at index (1, 3).

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 3, M = 3, target = 78,
mat[] = 
1 2 4
6 7 8 
9 10 34
Result: false
Explanation: The ‘target' = 78 does not exist in the 'mat'. Therefore in the output, we see 'false'.

Optimal Approach
Algorithm / Intuition
If we can figure out how to convert the index of the 1D array into the corresponding cell number in the 2D matrix, our task will be complete. In this scenario, we will use the binary search with the indices of the imaginary 1D array, ranging from 0 to (NxM)-1(total no. of elements in the 1D array = NxM). When comparing elements, we will convert the index to the cell number and retrieve the element. Thus we can apply binary search in the imaginary 1D array.''

If index = i, and no. of columns in the matrix = m, the index i corresponds to the cell with
row = i / m and col = i % m. More formally, the cell is (i / m, i % m)(0-based indexing).

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    int m = matrix[0].size();

    //apply binary search:
    int low = 0, high = n * m - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        int row = mid / m, col = mid % m;
        if (matrix[row][col] == target) return true;
        else if (matrix[row][col] < target) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return false;
}
Time Complexity: O(log(NxM)), where N = given row number, M = given column number.
Reason: We are applying binary search on the imaginary 1D array of size NxM.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
