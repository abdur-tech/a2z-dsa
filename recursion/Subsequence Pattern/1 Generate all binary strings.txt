 Binary strings with no consecutive 1s.



Problem statement
You have been given an integer 'N'. Your task is to generate and return all binary strings of length 'N' such that there are no consecutive 1's in the string.



A binary string is that string which contains only ‘0’ and ‘1’.



For Example:
Let ‘N'=3, hence the length of the binary string would be 3. 

We can have the following binary strings with no consecutive 1s:
000 001 010 100 101 

#include<bits/stdc++.h>

void rec(vector<string> &ans,int N,string s)
{
    
    if(s.size()==N)
    {
        ans.push_back(s);
        return;
    }
    rec(ans,N,s+'0');
    if(s[s.size()-1]!='1')
    {
        rec(ans,N,s+'1');
    }
}

vector<string> generateString(int N) {
    // Write your code here.
    vector<string> ans;
    rec(ans,N,"");
    return ans;
}
