Print all subsequences

Problem statement
Given a string 'S' of length 'N', return all the subsequences of the given string.



A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.



Note :
You may return the subsequences in any order but they will be printed in lexicographically ascending order.

If a string from the returned array has a length of zero, it will be represented as 'Empty String' in the output.
For Example:
For a given word “cn” the possible subsequences are 'Empty String', 'c', 'cn' and 'n'.

We get :
'Empty String' by deleting 'c' and 'n'.
'c' by deleting 'n'.
'n' by deleting 'c'.
'cn' if we don't delete any thing.

void helper(string s,int index,vector<string>& ans,string res){
    if(index == s.size()){
        ans.push_back(res);
        return;
    }
    // inclusion
    helper(s,index+1,ans,res+s[index]);
    // exclusion
    helper(s,index+1,ans,res);
}

vector<string> generateSubsequences(string s)
{
    vector<string> ans;
    helper(s,0,ans,"");
    return ans;
}
