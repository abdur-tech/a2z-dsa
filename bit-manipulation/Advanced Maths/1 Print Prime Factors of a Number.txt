Print Prime Factors of a Number

Given a number N. Find its unique prime factors in increasing order.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 100
Output: 2 5
Explanation: 2 and 5 are the unique prime
factors of 100.
Example 2:

Input: N = 35
Output: 5 7
Explanation: 5 and 7 are the unique prime
factors of 35.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function AllPrimeFactors() which takes N as input parameter and returns a list of all unique prime factors of N in increasing order.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)


public:
	vector<int>AllPrimeFactors(int N) {
	    vector<int> ans;
	    for(int i = 2;i*i<=N;i++)
	    {
	        if(N%i==0)
	        {
	            ans.push_back(i);
	            while(N%i==0) N=N/i;
	        }
	    }
	    if(N!=1)ans.push_back(N);
	    return ans;
	}
