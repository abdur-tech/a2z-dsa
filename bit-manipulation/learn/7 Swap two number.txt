Swap two number

Swap given two numbers and print them. (Try to do it without a temporary variable.) and return it.

Example 1:

Input: a = 13, b = 9
Output: 9 13
Explanation: after swapping it
becomes 9 and 13.
Example 2:

Input: a = 15, b = 8
Output: 8 15
Explanation: after swapping it
becomes 8 and 15.

pair<int, int> get(int a, int b){
        a = a^b;
        b = a^b; // (a^b)^b = a
        a = a^b; // (a^b)^a = b
        return {a,b};
    }
