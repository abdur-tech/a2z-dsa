Set the rightmost unset bit

Given a non-negative number N. The problem is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of N. If there are no unset bits, then just leave the number as it is.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
7
Explanation:
The binary representation of 6 is 110.
After setting right most bit it becomes
111 which is 7.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 15
Output:
15
Explanation:
The binary representation of 15 is 1111.
As there is no unset bit it remains the
same.

int setBit(int N)
{
       return N | (N+1);
}
