Count total set bits


You are given a number N. Find the total count of set bits for all numbers from 1 to N(both inclusive).


Example 1:

Input: N = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
For numbers from 1 to 4.
For 1: 0 0 1 = 1 set bits
For 2: 0 1 0 = 1 set bits
For 3: 0 1 1 = 2 set bits
For 4: 1 0 0 = 1 set bits
Therefore, the total set bits is 5.
Example 2:

Input: N = 17
Output: 35
Explanation: From numbers 1 to 17(both inclusive), 
the total number of set bits is 35.

int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        if(n==0) return 0;
        int pows = 1;
        while((1<<pows) <=n){
            pows++;                   //check the lowest power before n; 
        }
        pows--;
        
        return (pows*(1<<pows-1)) + (n-(1<<pows)+1) + countSetBits((n-(1<<pows)));
        
}
