Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
 
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(auto& it:nums){
            ans ^= it;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
xor of same number is 0, so we will get single of that array
