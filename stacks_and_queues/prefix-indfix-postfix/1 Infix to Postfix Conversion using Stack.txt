Infix to Postfix  search jenny video for explanation

Given an infix expression in the form of string str. Convert this infix expression to postfix expression.

Infix expression: The expression of the form a op b. When an operator is in-between every pair of operands.
Postfix expression: The expression of the form a b op. When an operator is followed for every pair of operands.
Note: The order of precedence is: ^ greater than * equals to / greater than + equals to -. Ignore the right associativity of ^.

Example 1:

Input: str = "a+b*(c^d-e)^(f+g*h)-i"
Output: abcd^e-fgh*+^*+i-
Explanation:
After converting the infix expression 
into postfix expression, the resultant 
expression will be abcd^e-fgh*+^*+i-
Example 2:

Input: str = "A*(B+C)/D"
Output: ABC+*D/
Explanation:
After converting the infix expression 
into postfix expression, the resultant 
expression will be ABC+*D/
