Find middle element in a Linked List

Problem Statement: Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


Examples:

Input Format: 
( Pointer / Access to the head of a Linked list )
head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Result: [3,4,5]
( As we will return the middle of Linked list the further linked list will be still available )

Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3 as in the below image.Examples:

Input Format: 
( Pointer / Access to the head of a Linked list )
head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Result: [3,4,5]
( As we will return the middle of Linked list the further linked list will be still available )

Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3 as in the below image.

 ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next)
            slow = slow->next, fast = fast->next->next;
        return slow;
    }
