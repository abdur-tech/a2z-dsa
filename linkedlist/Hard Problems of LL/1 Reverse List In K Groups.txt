Reverse List In K Groups

Problem statement
You are given a linked list of 'n' nodes and an integer 'k', where 'k' is less than or equal to 'n'.



Your task is to reverse the order of each group of 'k' consecutive nodes, if 'n' is not divisible by 'k', then the last group of nodes should remain unchanged.



For example, if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5, and 'k' is 3, we have to reverse the first three elements, and leave the last two elements unchanged. Thus, the final linked list being 3->2->1->4->5.



Implement a function that performs this reversal, and returns the head of the modified linked list.



Example:
Input: 'list' = [1, 2, 3, 4], 'k' = 2

Output: 2 1 4 3

Explanation:
We have to reverse the given list 'k' at a time, which is 2 in this case. So we reverse the first 2 elements then the next 2 elements, giving us 2->1->4->3.


Sample Input 1:
6
5 4 3 7 9 2
4 


Sample Output 1:
7 3 4 5 9 2


Explanation of the Sample Input 1:
For the given test case, we reverse the nodes in groups of four. But for the last 2 elements, we cannot form a group of four, so leave them as they are. The linked list becomes 7->3->4->5->9->2. Hence the output is 7 3 4 5 9 2


Sample Input 2:
4
4 3 2 8
4 


Sample Output 2:
8 2 3 4
