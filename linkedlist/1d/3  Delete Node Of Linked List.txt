Problem statement
You are given the head of a linked list ‘list’ of size ‘N’.



Your task is to delete the linked list's last node and return the linked list's head.



Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 4, ‘list’ = 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1

Output: 4 2 5

Explanation: 
After deleting the last node, the Linked List is 4 -> 2 -> 5.

Sample Input 1:
4
4 2 5 1
Sample Output 1 :
4 2 5
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
Input: ‘N' = 4, ‘list’ = 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1

Output: 4 2 5

Explanation: 
After deleting the last node, the Linked List is 4 -> 2 -> 5.
Sample Input 2:
5
4 3 2 1 5
Sample Output 2:
4 3 2 1
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
Input: ‘N’ = 5, ‘list’ = 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5

Output: 4 3 2 1

Explanation: 
After deleting the last node, the Linked List is 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.


Node *deleteLast(Node *list){
   Node* head = list;
   while(head->next->next)
   {
       head=head->next;
   }
   delete head->next;
   head->next=nullptr;
