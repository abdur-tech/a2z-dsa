Problem statement
You are given a Singly Linked List of integers with a head pointer. Every node of the Linked List has a value written on it.


Sample Input 1:
3 6 2 7 9 -1
2
Sample Output 1:
1
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
As value 2 exists in the given linked list. So we will return 1 in this case.

int searchInLinkedList(Node<int> *head, int k) {
   while(head)
   {
       if(head->data==k) return 1;
       head=head->next;
   }
   return 0;
}
